Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
* **Week 2**
* **Week 3**
* **Week 4**
* **Week 5**
* **Week 6**
* **Week 7**
* **Week 8** 
    Calibrate current properly, adding offset. See ardupilot code for example calibration methods. Run test discharge, store data. Add this as starting point for SoC estimation. Add temperature sensor.
    Look into INA226_WE code, and potentially modify INA3221 library to have similar functionality.
* **Week 9**
* **Week 10**
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** 
    Implement proper calibration equation with offset and multiplier, calibrate using external ammeter.
    Once this is completed, run test discharge as previously described.
    Begin trying to figure out how to estimate battery parameters based on test data.
    Status report submitted.

## Winter break
    Run battery discharge test, research performance estimation methods. Gather data from various drone flights.

## Spring Semester

* **Week 13**
    General code cleanup, refactor to use external files rather than a single file.
* **Week 14**
    Further research, decide on and implement performance estimation methods.
* **Week 15**
    Further research, decide on and implement performance estimation methods.
* **Week 16**
    Further research, decide on and implement performance estimation methods.
* **Week 17**
    Test the implemented method, gather results.
* **Week 19**
    Implement automatic warnings, triggered based on battery performance.
* **Week 20**
    Run final tests, gather data as required to sufficiently evaluate functionality.
* **Week 21**
    Finalise code, begin analysis of results and writing of dissertation.
* **Week 22**
    Finish first draft of dissertation, hand in early to allow for time to be checked by supervisor, and improved afterwards, work on final presentation.
* **Week 23 [TERM ENDS]**
    Finish first draft of dissertation, hand in early to allow for time to be checked by supervisor, and improved afterwards, work on final presentation.
* **Week 24** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
