Todo
Set limit for changing sim to a 5% difference in voltage, as this is the margin described in paper
Modify cell-difference calculation to give an average rather than absolute value
Re-plot results

Doing
Write dissertation

Done
Fix mocking timer
Fixed resistance estimation
Activate simulation and check results using mocked values
Activate simulation and check results for changing sim
Create current estimation based on filtering
LPF updates less when big values, time units likely wrong also
Created per-cell mocking for ina3221
Use average current for flight time estimation
Added watts estimation/ averaging
Add conditions for cell imbalances
Fixed flight time remaining bugs
Store results in good format and saved
