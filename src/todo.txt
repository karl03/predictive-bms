Todo

Doing
Re-plot results (run with new simulation values, generate mean errors and such, table with capacity estimations)
Write dissertation

Done
Fix mocking timer
Fixed resistance estimation
Activate simulation and check results using mocked values
Activate simulation and check results for changing sim
Create current estimation based on filtering
LPF updates less when big values, time units likely wrong also
Created per-cell mocking for ina3221
Use average current for flight time estimation
Added watts estimation/ averaging
Add conditions for cell imbalances
Fixed flight time remaining bugs
Store results in good format and saved
Modify cell-difference calculation to give an average rather than absolute value
