Todo
Store results in good format, plot and save
Add conditions for cell imbalances

Doing
Use average current for flight time estimation (maybe change for watts?)

Done
Fix mocking timer
Fixed resistance estimation
Activate simulation and check results using mocked values
Activate simulation and check results for changing sim
Create current estimation based on filtering
LPF updates less when big values, time units likely wrong also
Created per-cell mocking for ina3221
