- raw: Images of charger resistance estimate, raw outputs from monitor logging.
- mocks: Generated from raw outputs, to be used with the mocking class.
- notebooks: Notebooks used to generate output graphs and data.
- output-images: Pictures generated by notebook and other plotting software.
- testing-inputs: mocks modified to be identical to the detected input data by the bms, as some readings were missed/ flying was not started immediately so not all were logged. Used for plotting results.
- testing-outputs: outputs from running mocking class with various versions of the monitor.

- mapping for dissertation: describes how the battery enumaration used in testing was mapped for use in the dissertation.
- processed outputs.txt: the errors calculated between the real and simulated voltage in various tests.
