# Predictive Battery Monitoring System

This project reads voltage and current data from a drone battery in flight, and from this creates an estimation for the usable battery capacity, internal resistance, inter-cell performance, and flight time based on a battery model proposed by Olivier Tremblay.

The hardware parts list, and instructions on how to set up the model and other settings, is described in "manual.md".
